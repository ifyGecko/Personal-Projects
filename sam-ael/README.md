# sam-ael
PoC ELF Virus


Purpose:

	I wanted to do a project that would improve my skills with C while learning about infections, elf, and code protection. Thus,
	through curiosity sam-ael was born. The project will always remain in a defanged state only being practically useful as maybe
	a base for making a CTF challenge.

TODO:

    1) compression of infected host
    2) comment and improve readability
    3) error handling
    4) anti-debugging && obfuscation
