# sam-ael
PoC ELF Virus


Purpose:

	I wanted to do a project that would improve my skills with C while learning about infections, elf, and 
	code protection. Thus, through curiosity sam-ael was born. The project will always remain in a defanged 
	state only being practically useful as maybe a base for making a CTF challenge.

TODO:

	1) comment and improve readability
	2) error handling
	3) anti-debugging && obfuscation
	
RESEARCH:

	1) will higher entropy associated with encryption/compression impact stealth
