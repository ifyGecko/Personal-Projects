I got a copy of an assignment for CS524 a course on programming languages offered at my university the beginning of my sophmore year in college and thought it'd be a good exercise to see if I could replicate the assignment's expected functionality. I got bored one day and tackled it in a few hours, to my suprise it worked! I do not expect the code to 
be acceptable for the course itself since it is written in such an ad-hoc fashion but the point was never to have something of practical use that met coding expectation, for one I do not know them since I was not actually taking the class but solely as a practice exercise to see if I could even get close to the expected functionality.
