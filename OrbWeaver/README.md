Needed a way to memorize and be more familiar with derivative rules so I wrote this program to help enforce my memory of the different rules.

***For Warning***
I orginally had this project stored in multiple places across multiple files, which is one reason I put it on github. Therefor I have certainly lost bug fixes I've made and I know I have lost my test's. With this known I can say the general idea is here in the code provided and working for the most part, just take note that somethings may be slightly off or not yet finished.

***To Do***
1) re-write tests to cover simple examples(*for now*)
2) make algebraic simplification better
3) re-write "make" functions into a mutually recursive set named "build" and "simplify"
4) write new tests to demonstrate full use as a tool to find derivatives
5) re-write debug function to allow finer grain control over which functions are traced
